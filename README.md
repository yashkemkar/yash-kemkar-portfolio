# yash-kemkar-web-portfolio
 This is my web portfolio which I have created to showcase my programming skills and aid a potential employer in understanding why I would be a good fit for the job. The aim of this project is to collate all the skills I have learned and projects I have done into one beautiful platform.

 Given that this is my first web portfolio, if you have any recommendations for improvements I can be found on github @yash.kemkar (https://github.com/yashkemkar). You are welcome to leave an issue on my repo.

 Thanks for reading
